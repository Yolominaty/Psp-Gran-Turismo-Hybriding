In this folder you can find the codes for the us version of the game for both cwcheat and coderpr/nitepr.
The cheats.db file is for cwcheats and you just have to copy paste it into your cwcheats folder on your psp.
Same story with the UCUS-98632.txt file, just copy paste it into your coderpr folder on your psp.
